### **Paired Activity: Designing Two Connected Lessons**

**Task**:  
In pairs, develop **two connected 30-minute lessons** on a topic of your choosing for a group of learners of your choosing. Apply what you’ve learned today about lesson planning and instructional methods. Focus on how you will create a **cohesive learning experience** across two days. 

Consider the following:
- **Lesson Objectives**: What are the goals for each lesson, and how will they build on each other?
- **Instructional Methods**: Which methods will you use, and why?
- **Cohesion**: How will you connect the two lessons to create a seamless learning experience? 
- **Absenteeism**: How will you handle learners who miss one of the lessons? 
- **Differentiation**: How will you ensure all learners are supported throughout the lessons?
  
**Instructions**:
1. Work together to outline **both lessons** (objectives, materials, activities, timing, assessments).
2. You have **40 minutes** to complete this task.
3. **Email your outline** to me at **jpaiz@ccbcmd.edu** for posting on Brightspace.
4. Be prepared to discuss:
   - Challenges you encountered while designing the lessons.
   - Questions that arose during the planning process.
   - How you applied today’s concepts and your prior knowledge.
